*** WARNING: HERE BE DRAGONS! ***

This code was written for the final project of MIT 6.866 (Machine Vision).
It is a basic implementation of optical flow and FOE detection. The code
was written in a time long before I knew how to design code well.

All .c files are libraries, which are linked into the poorly-named
test.c. This program reads a series of PGM files (representing a
video), and outputs another series of PGM files with needles rendered
on it (representing the computed optical flow). It also will draw a
white dot on the image representing the FOE.

The included video2images.sh script and jpegtoavi binaries can aid in
converting a video to a series of PGM files.

# How to build and use
## Windows
1. You need to install Mingw utils
2. You need to install MPlayer
3. Use `make Makefile`
4. Преобразовать ролик в массив pgm картинок при помщои скрипта `video2images.sh`
5. Запустить test.exe передав аргументами префикс для названия временных файлов и исходные изображения
